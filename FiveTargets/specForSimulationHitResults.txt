Can you suggest a python script that provides a user command prompt that is to handle two 
commands, "send" or "exit". The exit command is to terminate the script, but the
send command should read one line from a text file, named testdata.txt, and send this to 
com port in windows. For each send command the script shall read the next line and send this
also to the com port, until it reads end of file, which will terminate the script.
